# Evaluation Result

Date: 2026-10-23
Evaluator: Claude (`claude-opus-5-5`, VS Code Claude Code extension 2.1.309), driven live as the MCP client in a fresh conversation (`0819d226…`) opened in an **empty folder outside the repository** (`C:\Users\Owner\Documents\gauss-ai-80x`), so neither this repository's `CLAUDE.md` nor its memory notes nor its `.mcp.json` were in the client's context (that folder's own memory directory is empty). An earlier conversation in the same folder (`ee5f3edc…`, 06:53 local) only started a session before the real-GAUSS opt-in was registered (`runner: fake`, `real_gauss_allowed: false`). The human asked each task in plain words, one at a time, and answered every run prompt themselves. All tasks ran on 2026-10-23, 06:59-07:18 local (10:59-11:18 UTC). During the tasks the client read no gauss-ai source, planning doc, `PROJECT_STATUS.md` or `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`, and read no GAUSS documentation file from disk; it ran `gauss-ai doctor` and two directory listings in PowerShell, and in 80.14 read the user's own `dccelib` package (`C:\gauss26\pkgs\dccelib`, an additional working directory of that Claude Code setup) from disk.
Agent Version: v0.89.1 (tag `v0.89.1`, commit `f6b9c6f`), installed as a stranger would: `pip install "gauss-ai[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/ec78/gauss-ai@v0.89.1"` into the user's Python 3.12 after `pip uninstall` of the editable install, with `~/.gauss-ai/` moved aside first (`gauss-ai version` = 0.89.1).
Prompt ID: 80.13
Prompt Category: MCP Clean-Install Walkthrough of v0.89.1 (Live Client)
Evidence source: Real `gauss-ai-mcp` v0.89.1 over stdio, registered at user scope (`claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user gauss-ai -e GAUSS_AI_MCP_ALLOW_REAL_GAUSS=1 -- gauss-ai-mcp`). Fresh config written by the quickstart: `docs_root` = `C:\Users\Owner\.gauss-ai\docs` (a new `gauss-ai docs fetch` on 2026-10-23), `gauss_executable` = `C:\gauss26\tgauss.exe`, `default_runner` = gauss, no workspace parent. One server session (`e28987e1…`) served every task; `gauss_session_start` reported `server_version: 0.89.1` and `real_gauss_allowed: true`. The client model wrote every query and snippet itself. Post-run: the recording session (this repository's own Claude Code session) re-ran every one of the 33 search, read and validation calls (8 searches, 11 reads, 14 validations) by calling `gauss_mcp_server`'s tool functions at the `v0.89.1` tag and on a `git archive` of `v0.88.0` (each archive's modules asserted imported), against the same docs copy. **Every live response equals the v0.89.1 re-run in every field** (`validation_id`, digests and the session id aside). Each non-candidate verdict was also diagnosed with `validate_code(...)` directly (`pre_execution.coverage`, `parameter_role_checks`). Real-GAUSS evidence: `tgauss.exe -b` (GAUSS 26.1.4) re-runs of every approved snippet and of the probes, each from its own new empty directory under the recording session's scratchpad.
Prompt Text:

"I have panel data cover 80 countries over 35 years. I want to check if the data is balanced? What GAUSS function should I use?"

Search `check if panel data is balanced` (#45): **ungrounded**, with two labeled candidates, `datalist` (`non_defining_page`) and **`pdAllBalanced`** (`derived_from_docs`, keywords `balanced`, `check`, `panel`). Identical on v0.88.0.

**The client followed the candidate back to its page** with `gauss_read_doc("pdallbalanced.rst", section="*")` (#46, 2,811 characters), and answered from it: returns 1 if strongly balanced, assumes long form sorted by group and date, and the optional `groupvar`/`datevar`. It offered `pdSort`, `pdSize`, `pdSummary` and `pdBalance`. Its template (`loadd`, `pdSort`, `pdAllBalanced`) was marked unvalidated, and it predicted the file read would block it.

Expected behavior: not planned (the user's own question).

Observed behavior: correct, through the candidate path v0.88.0 designed. A plain-language question about panel balance has no curated alias, so it is ungrounded (finding 5, an observation). Whether `pdSort` exists was not checked by the client.

Pass/fail: Pass
Defect severity: None
Remediation: None (observation: a candidate alias for panel balance)

Overall Score: 3.6
Decision: Pass
